<br><p>The story take place in a beautiful hilltop town of Turkey.This story is about an eight year old boy who dreams of the whirling dervish every night. Filled with his dreams and unanswered unanswered questions, he writes to Allah Almighty every day. On his way to school, he drops his letters in his mailbox, expecting immediate replies filled with answers. But the boy is disappointed every day. Allah never sends him a reply back. Deeply sad and dejected, he vows never to write Allah Almighty another letter.

But, as is usual, the very day he makes this promise, Allah Almighty writes him back! When he comes back home that day, there is a letter from Allah waiting for him and the smiling mom of our eight-year-old hero hands over that precious, precious letter to him.
